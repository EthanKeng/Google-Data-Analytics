# Some ideas for data analytics 
I am inspired by [this post in LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bellamy-al_two-weeks-ago-i-issued-a-challenge-to-the-activity-6825386926414020608-jFX3) that most of the people who acquired Google data analytic certificate have not completed the capstone project. So I told myslef not to be one of them.

> Find some fun topics. Do the final capstone project

Here are the topics I have come up with:
- Learning Japanese trend in Taiwan (or Asia)  
We all know Japan has its Lost Decades (失われた20年) and now its becoming 30 years since 1990s its economic has not growing anymore.  
So the idea here is to find some reliable dataset and to see if its economic down has a positive relationship with the language needs in Taiwan (or Asia)
- Coming soon...
