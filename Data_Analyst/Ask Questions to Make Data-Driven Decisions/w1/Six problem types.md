Six problem types
=================

Data analytics is so much more than just plugging information into a platform to find insights. It is about solving problems. To get to the root of these problems and find practical solutions, there are lots of opportunities for creative thinking. No matter the problem, the first and most important step is understanding it. From there, it is good to take a problem-solver approach to your analysis to help you decide what information needs to be included, how you can transform the data, and how the data will be used.  

基本上這些前言都是在說一些廢話，反正如果你想要做個好的資料分析師的話最好是先理解有6種不同的問題型態。 


Data analysts typically work with six problem types

A video, [Common problem types](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/lecture/8sRAJ/common-problem-types "This link takes you to the video lesson in this course: Common problem types."), introduced the six problem types with an example for each. The examples are summarized below for review.

### Making predictions

A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.
>這類的應用或者說問題應該是資料分析中最常見的，而且應該是一般人一想到就是這方面的問。 我現在的工作也是數位廣告相關的基本上真的很常應用過去的數據來推測未來投放廣告的預算如何分配等的。其實除此之外，前一份工作做不動產分析也是經常會用到過去的數據或者其他相關的數據來做預測的現金流分配或者投資的決策。


### Categorizing things

An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

### Spotting something unusual

A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.  
>我覺得找出不正常的特別點還蠻有趣的，最常出現的例子就是蘋果的手錶可以透過每天的熱量數據幫助你提早發現你的心律不整進而提前就醫。  

### Identifying themes

User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes.

By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.  
>認識主題和分門別類其實這2點還蠻像的，主要的差異在於認識主題在站在更高的點有點算是在分門別類之上再把它們各個分類放在同一個群組的概念。

### Discovering connections

A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries.

### Finding patterns

Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.

Key takeaway
------------

As you move through this program, you will develop a sharper eye for problems and you will practice thinking through the problem types when you begin your analysis. This method of problem solving will help you figure out solutions that meet the needs of all stakeholders.
>老實說我覺得這一次的課程有點硬湊的把它分成6類感覺是為了填充內容哈哈。不過有了這種六大分類的概念未來遇到相關問題可以做個簡單的腦中分類也是一個不錯的學習。
