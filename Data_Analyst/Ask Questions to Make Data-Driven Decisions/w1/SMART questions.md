More about SMART questions
==========================

Companies in lots of industries today are dealing with rapid change and rising uncertainty. Even well-established businesses are under pressure to keep up with what is new and figure out what is next. To do that, they need to ask questions. Asking the right questions can help spark the innovative ideas that so many businesses are hungry for these days.

The same goes for data analytics. No matter how much information you have or how advanced your tools are, your data won't tell you much if you don't start with the right questions. Think of it like a detective with tons of evidence who doesn't ask a key suspect about it.  Coming up, you will learn more about how to ask highly effective questions, along with certain practices you want to avoid.
>在這個變化快速的時代問一個對的問題或者說問一個聰明的問題非常的重要。上面那一段大概講的就是這個。


Highly effective questions are SMART questions:
-----------------------------------------------

Examples of SMART questions
---------------------------

Here's an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: What features do people look for when buying a new car?
>我覺得美國人真的很喜歡把好幾個單字放在一起用前面的第一個字母拼湊成另外一個常用的簡單的單字讓人方便記憶。S.m.a.r.t大家就把它記下來吧。

-   Specific: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?

>"現代的小孩運動充足嗎?" 我們可以把它改成
"現在的小孩有多少個百分比能夠達成一般科學推薦的每週5天每次60分鐘運動呢?"

-   Measurable: Does the question include a feature rating system?

>最近新上市的a商品賣的怎麼樣?" 我們可以把它改成 "最近新上市的A商品在上市後的一週內於網路平台上一共賣了幾件?大概多少營業額?"

-   Action-oriented: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?

-   Relevant: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?

-   Time-bound: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years?  

Questions should be open-ended. This is the best way to get responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential solutions to your specific problem. So, based on the thought process, possible SMART questions might be:

-   On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive?

-   What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?

-   What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?

-   How much more would you pay for a car with four-wheel drive?

-   Has four-wheel drive become more or less popular in the last three years?

Things to avoid when asking questions
-------------------------------------

Leading questions: questions that only have a particular response

-   Example: This product is too expensive, isn't it?

This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question. A better question might be, "What is your opinion of this product?" There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on pricing, you could ask a question like "What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?" This question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

Closed-ended questions: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only

-   Example: Were you satisfied with the customer trial?

This is a closed-ended question because it doesn't encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to give one-word responses that aren't very informative. A better question might be, "What did you learn about customer experience from the trial." This encourages people to provide more detail besides "It went well."

Vague questions: questions that aren't specific or don't provide context

-   Example: Does the tool work for you?

This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don't know. A better inquiry might be, "When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?" These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).

As a refresher, SMART questions are:

-   Specific: Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.

-   Measurable: Questions can be quantified and assessed.

-   Action-oriented: Questions encourage change.

-   Relevant: Questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve. 

-   Time-bound: Questions specify the time to be studied.

Next, you will use the SMART framework to ask effective questions about the scenario above. Then, you will reflect on the topics your SMART questions should address.

### Ask the right type of questions

You can apply the SMART framework to all types of questions. The type of questions you ask can help you explore deeper with your data. Consider the ways your questions help you examine objectives, audience, time, security, and resources.

Some common topics for questions include: 

-   Objectives: What are the goals of the deep dive? What, if any, questions are expected to be answered by this deep dive?

-   Audience: Who are the stakeholders? Who is interested or concerned about the results of this deep dive? Who is the audience for the presentation?

-   Time: What is the time frame for completion? By what date does this need to be done?

-   Resources: What resources are available to accomplish the deep dive's goals?

-   Security: Who should have access to the information?

Think about how you can ask SMART questions about each of these topics.

Asking real-world questions
---------------------------

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9IUix0wGS6yFIsdMBlusaw_6bbb6dd9906a4adaaa9a9e09994dea05_line-y.png?expiry=1641772800000&hmac=j_h2XJ-hFgLyoa0xDM9omFsTmaLIR5y6CqAMZ0I8WQY)

In this activity, you will have a *data conversation* with someone you know. This can be in person, over the phone, or in a video chat. 

Choose someone in your life who uses data to make better decisions. This might be a family member who runs a small business, a friend who leads a committee for the Parent Teacher Association, or a neighbor who teaches piano lessons. All of these people turn to data in some way to be more effective in their roles.

Let them know you're training to be a data analyst, and would like to have a chat about data to practice your skills asking questions. By the end of this conversation, you'll end up with some useful insights that will benefit both of you.

### Plan for the conversation

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/lhAoVghBTjWQKFYIQV413A_39bac42934a647d59def64e1ae3828dd_shortline-y.png?expiry=1641772800000&hmac=yKapn3vAD7wMbST1aYNGNHT0HBeOHVjjid0sw-OzBVQ)

First, decide who you will speak with and how they might use data. Your goal is to plan for a successful conversation. Think about how much time you need and how you will use it. For this step, review the following advice:

-   Prioritize your questions: Prepare to ask the most important and interesting questions first.

-   Make your time count: Stay on subject during the conversation.

-   Clarify your understanding: To avoid confusion, build in some time to summarize answers to make sure you understood them correctly. This will go a long way in helping you avoid mistakes. For example, in a conversation with a teacher, you might check your understanding with a statement like, "Just to double check that I understand what you're saying correctly, you currently use test scores in the following ways..."

Depending on the field they are in, the person you chat with may not be comfortable sharing detailed data with you. That's okay! Be sure to respect what they are willing to share during your conversation.

### Create questions

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/lhAoVghBTjWQKFYIQV413A_39bac42934a647d59def64e1ae3828dd_shortline-y.png?expiry=1641772800000&hmac=yKapn3vAD7wMbST1aYNGNHT0HBeOHVjjid0sw-OzBVQ)

Now, come up with questions to help you understand their business goals, the type of data they interact with, and any limitations of the data.

Use the SMART question framework to make sure each question you ask makes sense based on their field. Each question should meet as many of the SMART criteria as possible.

As a reminder, SMART questions are

-   Specific: Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.

-   Measurable: Questions can be quantified and assessed.

-   Action-oriented: Questions encourage change.

-   Relevant: Questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve. 

-   Time-bound: Questions specify the time to be studied.

For instance, if you have a conversation with someone who works in retail, you might lead with questions like: 

-   Specific: Do you currently use data to drive decisions in your business? If so, what kind(s) of data do you collect, and how do you use it?

-   Measurable: Do you know what percentage of sales is from your top-selling products?

-   Action-oriented: Are there business decisions or changes that you would make if you had the right information? For example, if you had information about how umbrella sales change with the weather, how would you use it?

-   Relevant: How often do you review data from your business?

-   Time-bound: Can you describe how data helped you make good decisions for your store(s) this past year?

If you are having a conversation with a teacher, you might ask different questions, such as: 

-   Specific: What kind of data do you use to build your lessons?

-   Measurable: How well do student benchmark test scores correlate with their grades?

-   Action-oriented: Do you share your data with other teachers to improve lessons?

-   Relevant: Have you shared grading data with an entire class? If so, do students seem to be more or less motivated, or about the same?

-   Time-bound: In the last five years, how many times did you review data from previous academic years?

If you are having a conversation with a small business owner of an ice cream shop, you could ask:

-   Specific: What data do you use to help with purchasing and inventory?

-   Measurable: Can you order (rank) these factors from most to least influential on sales: price, flavor, and time of year (season)?

-   Action-oriented: Is there a single factor you need more data on so you can potentially increase sales?

-   Relevant: How do you advertise to or communicate with customers?

-   Time-bound: What does your year-over-year sales growth look like for the last three years?

### Take good notes

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/lhAoVghBTjWQKFYIQV413A_39bac42934a647d59def64e1ae3828dd_shortline-y.png?expiry=1641772800000&hmac=yKapn3vAD7wMbST1aYNGNHT0HBeOHVjjid0sw-OzBVQ)

It is important to take good notes during your conversation. Your notes should be comprehensive and useful. To help you capture meaningful notes, you should stick to a process of asking a question, clarifying your understanding of their response, and then briefly recording it in your notes.

Remember: If a question is worth asking, then the answer is worth recording. Commit yourself to taking great notes during your conversation.

Helpful aspects of your conversation to note include:

-   Facts: Write down any concrete piece of information, such as dates, times, names, and other specifics.

-   Context: Facts without context are useless. Note any relevant details that are needed in order to understand the information you gather.

-   Unknowns: Sometimes you may miss an important question during a conversation. Make a note when this happens so you can figure out the answer later. 

For example, if the previous SMART questions led the ice cream shop owner to propose a project to analyze customer flavor preferences, your notes might appear something like this:

-   Project: Collect customer flavor preference data.

-   Overall business goal: Use data to offer or create more popular flavors.

-   Two data sources: Cash register receipts and completed customer surveys (email).

-   Target completion date: Q2 

-   To do: Call back later and speak with the manager about the location of survey data.

The notes you will take will differ greatly based on the data conversation you have. The important thing is that your notes are clear, organized, and concise.

Now you are ready to have a great conversation about data in real life.
