One of the most important functions of a resume is communicating your prior work experience in a favorable light. This can often be challenging, as the one-page format forces job seekers to summarize all of their work experience into a few bullet points. 

Resume best practices will help you select the most relevant parts of your work experience and communicate them in the shortest, most impactful way possible. 

As you think about how to represent your work experience on your resume effectively, it might be helpful to refer to these best practices:

Focus on your accomplishments first, and explain them using the formula "Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z." 

-   These statements help you communicate the most important things a recruiter or hiring manager is searching for---the impact of your work.

-   Whenever possible, use numbers to explain your accomplishments. For example, "Increased manufacturing productivity by 15% by improving shop floor employee engagement," is better than "Increased manufacturing productivity."

Phrase your work experience and duties using Problem-Action-Result (PAR) statements. 

-   For example, instead of saying "was responsible for two blogs a month," phrase it as "earned little-known website over 2,000 new clicks through strategic blogging." 

Describe jobs that highlight transferable skills (those skills that can transfer from one job or industry to another). 

-   This is especially important if you are transitioning from another industry into data analytics. 

-   For example, communication is a skill often used in job descriptions for data analysts, so highlight examples from your work experience that demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively.

Describe jobs that highlight your soft skills.

-   These are non-technical traits and behaviors that relate to how you work.

-   Are you detail-oriented? Do you have grit and perseverance? Are you a strong critical thinker? Do you have leadership skills? 

-   For instance, you could give an example of when you demonstrated leadership on the job.

-   Showing is always more effective than telling. 

This is almost always the hardest part of crafting a resume, especially if you are transitioning from a different career field. However, if you take a moment to think deeply about your previous work experience, you'll likely discover that you can find ways to represent your work experiences in a way that highlights your ability to do things important to data analyst roles, such as thinking critically or making data-driven decisions.

### Get the interview first

Remember that the goal of a resume is to get you an interview. You may find that you need to brainstorm and carefully edit your resume to effectively summarize your background. In the end, you will have all of your various responsibilities and accomplishments from previous jobs synthesized into a few bullet points. That way, your resume will highlight what potential employers like to know about applicants.

Effective resumes communicate that you are a candidate who understands the needs of the role and you have the skills and experience to warrant an interview. During interviews, you can expect questions about your experience and that's when you can go into more detail.

Add your work experience

Now that you have had some time to think about your work experience, add it to your resume. Keep in mind the best practices we shared above and that creating a resume is a process. You'll likely come back to work on it multiple times and change phrasing or formatting. With effort and time, you'll eventually get your resume to a place where you're satisfied with the final result.

Earlier, you downloaded a template of bullet points describing work experience. Refer to this as you write about your own work experience. Notice how it demonstrates factual, measurable successes and job experience that is applicable to the role of a data analyst in a short, concise manner.

If you need inspiration or want to see how other data analysts have structured their resumes, take a moment to search for resumes of real data analysts. You can find these easily on sites such as LinkedIn. Seeing how other data analysts have structured and worded their own resumes may give you valuable insight about more effective ways to highlight your own experience.
