A changelog is a document used to record the notable changes made to a project over its lifetime across all of its tasks. It is typically curated so that the changes it records are listed chronologically across all versions of the project.

The major benefit to using changelogs is that contributors and users connected with the project get a specific list of what important alterations have been made, when they were made, and sometimes, what version they were released for. It is an invaluable tool for communicating how the project has evolved over time to coworkers, management, and stakeholders.

### Best practices for changelogs

A changelog for a personal project may take any form desired. However, in a professional setting and while collaborating with others, readability is important. These guiding principles help to make a changelog accessible to others:Â 

-   Changelogs are for humans, not machines, so write legibly.

-   Every version should have its own entry.

-   Each change should have its own line.

-   Group the same types of changes. For example, *Fixed* should be grouped separately from *Added*.

-   Versions should be ordered chronologically starting with the latest.

-   The release date of each version should be noted.

All the changes for each category should be grouped together. Types of changes usually fall into one of the following categories:

-   Added: new features introduced

-   Changed: changes in existing functionality

-   Deprecated: features about to be removed

-   Removed: features that have been removed

-   Fixed: bug fixes

-   Security: lowering vulnerabilities
