Best practices for file naming conventions
------------------------------------------

Review the following file naming recommendations:

-   Work out and agree on file naming conventions early on in a project to avoid renaming files again and again.

-   Align your file naming with your team's or company's existing file-naming conventions.

-   Ensure that your file names are meaningful; consider including information like project name and anything else that will help you quickly identify (and use) the file for the right purpose.

-   Include the date and version number in file names; common formats are YYYYMMDD for dates and v## for versions (or revisions).

-   Create a text file as a sample file with content that describes (breaks down) the file naming convention and a file name that applies it.

-   Avoid spaces and special characters in file names. Instead, use dashes, underscores, or capital letters. Spaces and special characters can cause errors in some applications.

Best practices for keeping files organized
------------------------------------------

Remember these tips for staying organized as you work with files:

-   Create folders and subfolders in a logical hierarchy so related files are stored together.

-   Separate ongoing from completed work so your current project files are easier to find. Archive older files in a separate folder, or in an external storage location.

-   If your files aren't automatically backed up, manually back them up often to avoid losing important work.


When creating a file structure and naming convention pattern for a project, you should always:

-   Work out your conventions early in your project. The earlier you start, the more organized you'll be. 

-   Align file naming conventions with your team. Conventions are most useful when everyone follows them.

-   Make sure filenames are meaningful. Stick to a consistent pattern that contains the most useful information needed.

-   Keep file names short and to the point.

This includes understanding the expected structure of folders and files in a project. Where does your data live? Your spreadsheets? Your data visualizations? Being able to navigate your folders easily makes for a well-structured project. 

Remember, there are some stylistic choices you'll need to make when it comes to filename conventions. However, there are still best practices you should follow here, too:

| Formatting Convention                            | Example                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Format Dates as yyyymmdd                         | SalesReport20201125            |
| Lead revision numbers with 0                     | SalesReport20201125v02         |
| Use hyphens, underscores, or capitalized letters | SalesReport\_2020\_11\_25\_v02 |
